# lc3-simulator

A terminal-based LC3 simulator I wrote in C\
I made this to speedrun assignments in my Systems course (the provided one is GUI-based in Java T-T)\
there is no RTI because I don't know what that does\
there are also many inconsistencies to an actual lc3 because it's 2025 and i deserve QOL\
\
Maybe one day I will make an assembler
